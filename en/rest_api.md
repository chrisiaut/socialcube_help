## How Socialcube works

Socialcube is designed for grading with Christian Haschek's [XP based grading system](https://blog.haschek.at/xp-based-grading-system).

### Institutions
On the site **institutions** (schools, universities, etc.) can be reigstered and teachers and students can join on a email- or code based invite system.

### Courses
Every Teacher in an institution can create **courses**. These courses represent classes

### Sections
Every course can have multiple **sections**. Sections are usually the topics the teacher is teaching in this class.

In these sections **XP** can be given to all students attending this course.

### Example
A professor of MIT (**Institution**) teaches "Advanced computer science" (**Course**) and divides the course in the topics "cryptography", "bash scripting" and "game theory" (**Sections**).

They give out an assignment in cryptography that will be graded in XP. Students who hand in the assignment receive a value of XP determined by the professor in the section cryptography.

## The goal

The goal of this API is to create an interface between the students performance and external sites. If you are a game developer you can reward your students in your game when they get XP in school/university.
